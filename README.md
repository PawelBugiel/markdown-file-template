### Functional-programming repository
___

The repository was created for training purposes, to refresh the acquired knowledge.
I wrote the code in relation to a content provided in Udemy course, but there is also some of my implementation.

As a base for it I used the following Udemy course
> *Udemy course title :*  **Learn Functional Programming in Java with Lambdas and Streams**   
> *created by* **in28minutes**    
> [Link to the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/functional-programming-with-java "Nice content for a start.")

#### My thoughts :
- there are two coding approaches in Java : an imperative and a declarative
- the declarative approach changes the way the Java developers think about coding itself
- on the one hand, the functional programming is even more abstract, and on the other hand, in the appropriate scenarios, can provide a way more readable, less verbose code.
- using the declarative approach you tell what need to be done, not how to do it.

A note. 

I used the chat GPT 3.5 to create this markdown readme file.
AI mainly helped me with :
- markdown syntax 
- extracting needed content from my source code.
