#### two
- there are two coding approaches in Java : an imperative and a declarative
- the declarative approach changes the way the Java developers think about coding itself
- on the one hand, functional programming is even more abstract, and on the other hand, in appropriate scenarios, it can provide much more readable, less verbose code.
- using the declarative approach you tell what need to be done, not how to do it.

A note. 

I used the chat GPT 3.5 to create this markdown readme file.
AI mainly helped me with :
- markdown syntax 
- extracting needed content from my source code.
